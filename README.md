# "Probabilistic ODE Solvers in Millions of Dimensions" - Experiments

This repo contains the experiment code for the paper "Probabilistic ODE Solvers in Millions of Dimensions", which is accepted at ICML 2022, currently avaiable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11812).

## Run Experiments
Before running anything, install the package with
```
pip install -e .
```

To reproduce an experiment and create the corresponding figure, two scripts need to be run:
1. The actual experiment script is located in `./experiments/`.
   This generates the results, stored in `./results`.
2. The plotting scripts are located in `./plotting_scripts`.


For example, to reproduce figure 0, first run
```
python experiments/0_diagonalek1_pdesolution.py
```
and then
```
python plotting_scripts/0_diagonalek1_pdesolution.py
```
