# "Probabilistic ODE Solvers in Millions of Dimensions" - Experiments

This repo contains the experiment code for the paper "Probabilistic ODE Solvers in Millions of Dimensions", which is accepted at ICML 2022, currently avaiable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11812).

## Run Experiments
Before running anything, install the package with
```
pip install -e .
```

`./experiments/` contains the scripts to run the experiments and create the corresponding figure.
They can be run directly from the root directory.
For example, to fully reproduce figure 0, run
```
python experiments/0_diagonalek1_pdesolution.py
```

`./plotting_scripts/` contains scripts to only create figures without running the actual experiments; they plot the data stored in the corresponding `./results/` folder.
